```javascript
// AI-powered question generation
const assessment = await createAssessment(skills, role);
const result = await submitAssessment(assessmentId, answers, questions);
// Automatic XP and achievement processing
```

### Learning Management
```javascript
// Module content delivery
const module = await getModule(moduleId, trackId);
const exerciseResult = await submitExercise(moduleId, exerciseId, answer);
// Progress tracking with milestone rewards
```

### Gamification Engine
```javascript
// Achievement system
await unlockAchievement('FIRST_ASSESSMENT');
await recordActivity('assessment_complete', metadata);
// Real-time notifications and XP rewards
```
